%description
Packages in the denso suite provide controller functionality for Denso's
industrial manipulators. ORiN (Open Robot interface for the Network) is a
unified network interface for industrial robot applications and has been stably
utilized in Denso's manipulators for years. Controllers in this package suite
uses b-CAP, UDP-based control protocol defined in ORiN. It also has mechanism to
detect faulty commands. Using b-CAP, ROS communicates to the embedded controller
computer that has been achieving industry-proven reliability. The computer also
has mechanism to detect faulty commands. That said as a whole the system
maintains the same level of safeness with their commercial product setting.
Also, as a genuine ROS package, it enables robot application developers to
access full ROS features. MoveIt! configuration package is also included for
some of Denso's robots. Core functionality
